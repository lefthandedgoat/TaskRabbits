- added the Memoize module, the memoize module will cache values of your
  methods

public class SlowPerson : Gemini
{
    static SlowPerson()
    {
        Gemini.Extend<SlowPerson, Memoize>();
    }

    IEnumerable<dynamic> Memoize()
    {
        //define a method called Memoize
        //and state that you want to memoize the SayHello
        //method
        yield return (DynamicFunctionWithParam)SayHello;
    }

    //this function will be called the first time and 
    //any subsequent call with the same parameters
    //will return a cached value
    dynamic SayHello(dynamic otherPerson)
    {
        System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(10000);

        return "Hello " + otherPerson.Name;
    }
}

- oak, oak-edge, cambium:
    - Bug fix on changes module to only look at writable properties as opposed to all properties
    - Added Bullet.cs which can be used to find N+1 query and redundant Query issues

If you are upgrading your version of oak, you'll have to add the following line to Global.asax to incorporate Bullet:
Inside global.asax.cs:
public class MvcApplication : System.Web.HttpApplication
{
    public MvcApplication()
    {
        DebugBootStrap.Init(this); /* <--- this line will incoporate N+1, redudant query, and exception notification in iisexpress */
    }
}

- gemini: added and introspection method called HashOfWritableProperties()

=============== CHANGES ==================
- Added StrongParameters module to protect against mass assignment via SetMembers, here is an example usage:
    dynamic securedObject = new Gemini(new { FirstName = "Jane", LastName = "Doe" });

    securedObject.Extend<StrongParameters>();

    securedObject.Permit("FirstName", "LastName");

    //this line would throw an error if set members are attempted on properties
    //that weren't premitted
    securedObject.SetMembers(new { FirstName = "First", LastName = "Last" });

    (securedObject.FirstName as string).should_be("First");

    (securedObject.LastName as string).should_be("Last");

cambium 1.2.3+
=============== CHANGES ==================
- Camibum and company now plays nice with auto properties.
  If you get the Invalid column name Exception when saving a Gemini, 
  you can remove properties from Gemini's using the Exclude() method.  
  Override your repository's GetAttributesToSave()
  these columns from being persisted.
  Example: https://github.com/amirrajan/Oak/blob/master/Sample%20Apps/BorrowedGames/BorrowedGames/Repositories/WantedGames.cs
- Added InitializeExtensions method. If you want to leverage mix-ins, 
  this method need to be explicitly called in the constructor of classes
  that use *static* auto properties. Invocation is automatically done
  if you use dynamic properties.
- The Expando property in Gemini is now named Prototype.
- Case invariant dictionary is used now to store dynamic properties (ie Prototype).
